Role-Based Access Control is a security mechanism that:
- Assigns roles to users
- Grants permissions based on roles
- Prevents unauthorized access to protected features

## ✨ Features

- User authentication (login / signup)
- Role assignment (Admin, User)
- Access restriction based on role
- Protected routes or functions
- Simple and scalable access control logic

## 🛠 Technologies Used

*(Update this if needed)*

- Programming Language: Java / Python / JavaScript
- Framework: Spring Boot / Django / Express / FastAPI
- Database: MySQL / MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT / Session-based

## ▶ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rushi0369/RoleBasedAccess.git
